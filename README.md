- **Test Case Steps**
	- Given
	- When
	- Then

- **Test Coverage**
	- Once we write few tests, we can check the Test Coverage for the particular class by Run Test with Coverage option.
	- We can see the % covered for Classes level, Method level, Coverage by Lines.
	- Based on that, we can add more tests for better coverage.
